Since the renderer hasnt bee updated to the newest grammar that introduces meta tags, i will add the tags under this paragraph.

@h1 Specification

@h2 Outline

@paragraph

First we will outline the three major components any search engine needs.
Then I will go somewhat in depth about what each component should be doing and lastly,
I will expand on the technology stack used.

@h3 Components

@list
	1. The Crawler
	2. Index
	3. Ranking Algorithm

@paragraph
The crawler as the name implies, will work torwards crawling web pages, this involves checking
the health of web resources, indexing web resources and relatetd, in a autonomous manner.

@paragraph
The index will be the database engine that allows us to efficiently retrieved crawled data
for later use, this is vital for both the crawler and the ranking algorithm as they both
depend on the index, to perform their jobs efficiently.

@paragraph
The ranking algorithm is an algorithm that allows us to retreive resources and its dependants
from the index based on how the algorithms ranked the indexed informations.


@h2 The Crawler

@paragraph
Here the crawlers algorithm will be detailed.
In theory the crawler sounds like the easiest component to implement within the engine,
and it technically is but that does not mean it doesnt share its bit of complexity.

@bi[*NOTICE* that when I say resources it can mean the resource itself (as a whole) or its routes (dependants)]

@list
1. The crawler grabs a batch of resources from the index, these resources will be aquired
in the following manner. The ones with the highest priorities will be resources that have not been
visited yet, those that have been merely indexed. If all resources have been indexed and visited we fall back
and aquire a batch of resources whose last_crawled field is earliest or oldest.

2. Upon aquiring a batch of resources we begin building links, we only want to persist resources
that are https protected. The crawler will grab those resources and begin building https urls.
If the https url is invalid due to cert issues the error will be logged and the resource will be marked with a grace period,
of 7 days.

The same idea will apply for resources that end up returning 4xx or 5xx errors, they will be flagged
and granted a grace period before removal.

3. If crawler receives certain errors that may hinder the performance of the server or may cause it to be blocked.
\\423, 500, etc. The crawler will slow down, we can achieve this with a database flag within the Resource table.
We may also build a ResourceError table where we put the grace period and the error code that we are working with, for the resource in question.

4. If a grace period is not required and a resource status is ok, we simply proceed to begin
crawling for a[href] tags. Every href tag will get added as a new last_crawled NULL resource
within the database. If the href tag points to the same domain as the resource we are currently
crawling, the href tag will have its route stripped and the route will be used as a dependant
of the current resource, ResourceRoute will also have a last_crawled field that will be set to NULL.

5. Similarly when crawling for page links, we need to build a resource title and description
before saving the entry into the database. The crawler will have a seperate parseMeta() function
that will be called to parse titles, meta elements, and if non of that exists, it will fallback
to parsing <h1> or <p> elements that are at the top of the page (first comes first serves).

In the future though, it would be cool if we could grab all the content from a page, process it. And decide what should be used as the
@bold[ideal] description. But for now we shall keep it primitive.

@h2 The Index

@paragraph

Here I shall outline the database schema, and maybe some retrieval processes.


@list
	* The resource table will be used in order to index web domains for crawling purposes, since the crawler wont batch Resources themselves
	unless they havent been crawled before, we simply use a status to identify whether it has been crawled before or not.
	If it hasnt been crawled before it will be visited, and crawled as a priority resource within a batch of resources.
	@code ["sql"]
<<
	CREATE TABLE `Resource` (
		id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		full_domain VARCHAR(253) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
		last_crawled TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,
		status ENUM('DISCOVERED', 'CRAWLED'),
		created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
	);
>>
	* The resource route table will be used to track routes related to a resource. It will save some basic information
	like the amount of visits to the route, a last crawled date, description, title, and hopefully in the future some more meta data.
	@code ["sql"]
<<
	CREATE TABLE `ResourceRoute` (
		id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		resource_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
		route_path VARCHAR(2000) NOT NULL,
		title VARCHAR(125) NOT NULL,
		description VARCHAR(175) DEFAULT NULL,
		visit_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		last_crawled TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,
		created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		FOREIGN KEY (`resource_id`) REFERENCES `Resource`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
	);
>>

	* The resource route error table will be used to track whether a route is undergoing an error that will hinder the search for relevant resources.
	500, 404, 523, etc. If any 4xx or 5xx error occurs, the resource route error will track it. This is also where the grace period of a certain
	route will be if the error does not go away. When the grace period ends, the route will be scheduled for elimination.
	@code ["sql"]
<<

	CREATE TABLE ResourceRouteError (
		id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		resource_route_id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
		status_code SMALLINT NOT NULL,
		grace_period TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
		created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		FOREIGN KEY (`resource_route_id`) REFERENCES `ResourceRoute`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
	);
>>

	* The resource reference table will be used to track the number of references between resources, this will be used during the ranking process.
	If a resource is being referenced a lot by other resources, it means that in a way, this resources is vital to our web. It should naturally
	be placed at a higher rank than average. This is just one factor of the ranking algorithm, there will be more.
	@code ["sql"]
<<
	CREATE TABLE `ResourceReference` (
		resource_referenced_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
		resource_referencer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
		created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		FOREIGN KEY (`resource_referenced_id`) REFERENCES `Resource`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
		FOREIGN KEY (`resource_referencer_id`) REFERENCES `Resource`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
		PRIMARY KEY (`resource_referenced_id`, `resource_referencer_id`)
	);

@h3 Ranking Algorithm - BM25 Reference Variation

@paragraph
@link[@bold[BM25 WIKIPEDIA SOURCE], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25"]

@paragraph
1. Given a query (Q) with an Q(n) amount of keywords, we need to match them against a document D.
A document can represent a text field within the ResourceRoute record, title, description, etc.
My take is that we compute a seperate score for each field and perform a sum, so titleScore + descScore = Score.

So to reitarate the first step here is to compute the total matches of keywords between document and query.

For example take the query "How do I learn programming?", and take the description
"Prorgramming is a learnable and very in demand field."


@h3 Example:
   @list
         * Q"learn" -> D"learnable" (If following a minimum munch during tokenization)
         * Q"programming" -> D"Programming"


So the output of the match function would be a hash map containing the keyword and frequency, e.g:

@code <<  return { "learn": 1, "programming": 1 }  >>
This all ultimately represent the f(q[i], D) found within the formula.
